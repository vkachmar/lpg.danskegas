              Danske Gas proudly took part in this year’s Future of Energy Forum, one of Europe’s most influential gatherings of energy leaders, innovators, and policymakers. Held in Berlin, the event united companies from over 30 countries to explore how the energy sector can respond to today’s most urgent challenges—decarbonization, energy security, and sustainable growth.

                      Our CEO opened the session by highlighting Danske Gas’ two-pronged strategy: maintaining high-performance delivery of conventional fuels while investing in scalable green energy solutions. With the European energy mix evolving rapidly, the company emphasized that a hybrid approach is not only realistic—but essential.

                    <div>
                      Danske Gas also presented its framework for <b>integrated energy procurement,</b> allowing clients to combine conventional fuel contracts with renewable certificates, CO₂ offsets, or biomass solutions under one agreement. This flexible model gives clients a realistic path to greener operations — without compromising performance or delivery.

                    <div>
                      With operations expanding across Central and Northern Europe, the company reaffirmed its commitment to infrastructure investment, cross-sector collaboration, and innovation — not just in what energy is delivered, but how it’s delivered.
